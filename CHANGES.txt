Changelog
=========

0.1.12 (2013-01-21)
-------------------

- Make sure the cycle script is run as run and only when there is a pound socket.


0.1.11 (2012-10-25)
-------------------

- Don't invoke poundctl when working out which backends to use. This avoids the

-------------------

- Refactor resuable cycle logic into a Backend class.

- Ensure the listen address is in correct state before moving onto next
  backend.

- You can optionally poke URL's on the backend to ensure it has started.


0.1.9 (2012-10-01)
------------------

- Add a default emergency page.


0.1.8 (2012-07-03)
------------------

- No changes - release to fix version sync weirdness?


0.1.7 (2012-07-03)
------------------

- Restore python2.4 compatibility


0.1.6 (2012-02-03)
